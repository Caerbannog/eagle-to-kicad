NOTE: ***** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK *****

This contains the eagle file's from OLIMEX/OLINUXINO from github, which have been Renumbered to work with KiCad
as KiCad will not work correctly with out parts reference ending in a number.
Also note the Eagle files have been converted to version 6.xx of eagle.

*** NOTE: you have to enable LIB prifix in the eagle6xx-sch-to-kicad-sch.ulp even thou is shows you don't need it.
          for some reson Ealge has a lib part which has the same name, as the ground part,  but dose not show up
          when the script searchs for conflicking part names, but show's up on the lib !!!  go figure !!!  ****
