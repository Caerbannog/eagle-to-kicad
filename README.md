<b><i>WARNING: You should check the results of the conversion! As there is no way this program will make a perfect conversion<i></b>
<b><font color=red>BUGS and and warnings:<br>  1: Text can appear on any layer in Eagle lib's, where as KiCad only allows Text on top layer<br>
This will result in all text from eagle appearing on the top silk screen layer, and mirrored text will no longer be mirrored !</font>
